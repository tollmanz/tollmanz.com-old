My name is Zack Tollman. I am a Web Developer at [The Theme Foundry](https://thethemefoundry.com). While I am well versed in general web development, WordPress is my bread and butter. I enjoy working on WordPress projects, writing plugins, and helping other learn about appreciate how incredible the WordPress software is.

After about 8 years doing web development, I have finally launched my own website. I&#8217;d like to think it&#8217;s because I finally feel that I have something to say, but really, it&#8217;s actually because I was finally able to design a theme that I did not loathe.

I hope to be writing about fun and interesting WordPress topics for the foreseeable future. I hope to expand on the structure of the site and add a few features along the way. I also tend to use personal sites as testing grounds for new ideas and concepts, so there will definitely be some downtime along the way.
