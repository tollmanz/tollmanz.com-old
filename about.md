My name is Zack Tollman. I am Lead Engineer at [WIRED](http://www.wired.com). While I am well versed in general web development, WordPress is my bread and butter. I enjoy working on WordPress projects, writing plugins, and helping other learn about appreciate how incredible the WordPress software is. Additionally, I am interested in performance and security.

I hope to be writing about fun and interesting WordPress, performance, and security topics for the foreseeable future. I hope to expand on the structure of the site and add a few features along the way. I also tend to use personal sites as testing grounds for new ideas and concepts, so there will definitely be some downtime along the way.

If you need to get in touch with me, feel free to reach out at tollmanz (at) gmail *dot* com.
