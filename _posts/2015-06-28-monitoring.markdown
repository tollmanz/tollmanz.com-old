Real User Monitoring (RUM) is an important aspect of performance optimization. RUM allows you to track and analyze how real world users of your web properties *actually* experience your website. RUM is an important part of performance monitoring as you collect the real experiences of your users, as opposed to the contrived data inherit in synthetic monitoring (e.g., [Web Page Test](http://www.webpagetest.org); it's still really important!). If you've ever used Google Analytics, you've engaged in RUM before; however, RUM for web performance is more difficult because there is no service like Google Analytics that makes setting up web performance monitoring so easy. Well...there are a number of easy-to-install, pricey SaaS offerings, but those tend to be out of reach for the web performance enthusiast that wants to get started with RUM.

In this article, I want to introduce you to components of an inexpensive system to setting up RUM for a website. The set up is not for the faint of heart, but it is by far the easiest system I've put together for simple RUM. I will first discuss the components of the system, then dive into instructions for how you can set up such a system.

## General Setup

For our performance monitoring setup to work, we need four main components. Having each of these components perform an individual task makes the focus of each component very specific; however, it comes at the cost of maintaining separate systems. Fortunately, the method I'll discuss is not terribly frustrating.

**Component 1: Javascript Data Collection**

We are attempting to collect front end performance data. Without controlling the client connecting to the website, we are left to depend on JS APIs to collect data on the client side. The [Navigation Timing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Navigation_timing) and [Resource Timing](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/) APIs, along with the clever timing of events on the client can all provide useful data about your site's performance. The first part of our monitoring involves uses these APIs and custom JS to collect the metrics we intend to track.

To this end, I use the wonderful [Boomerang](https://github.com/lognormal/boomerang) JS component for this purpose. Originally, developed by Yahoo, this library is currently maintained by [SOASTA](http://www.soasta.com/), a monitoring SaaS. As far as I can tell, the script is similar to what you would deploy on your site if you used SOASTA's service. It handles the hard work of normalizing data across browsers, surfacing useful metrics, and kicking off a beacon request so the data can be recorded. Boomerang has a plugin architecture that allows you to add more data to the beacon request. Additionally, the library comes with a number of plugins that exposes data that most people will already be interested in.

This component is only concerned with *taking measurements* and does not care about data format or storage. After taking its measurements, it passes the data to the next component in the system so it can be formatted and stored. As an example, Boomerang sends a request like the following on my website:

{% highlight bash %}
https://www.tollmanz.com/beacon?rt.start=navigation&rt.tstart=1435547327736&
rt.bstart=1435547328225&rt.end=1435547328345&t_resp=209&t_page=400&t_done=609&

To ravel that a bit, an easier to read version of the GET vars looks like:

{% highlight bash %}
rt.start:navigation

{% endhighlight %}

That request can be caught and handled with the second component in the system.

**Component 2: Middleware to Format and Route Beacon Data**

After Boomerang sends a beacon request, it must be handled by a server side component. At this point, we need to implement a middleware that takes the raw data collected by the client and converts it into a data that can be processed for storage. In this case, we want it to follow a common time-series data format that many storage engines are optimized to handle. The middleware needs to convert this data and pass it along for processing.

For this middleware, I use [Boomcatch](https://github.com/nature/boomcatch), which is a middleware that was built specifically for use with Boomerang. Boomerang is a [Node based server](http://cruft.io/posts/introducing-boomcatch/) that handles the Boomerang formatted data. You could write your own middleware, but the beauty of Boomcatch is that it will process all of the core Boomerang plugin data out of the box.

As an example of how Boomcatch handles data, the following reformatted log shows how a request is manipulated into more manageable data and it is passed to our 3rd component:

{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight %}

Notice the formatted data. For example, one piece of data that is passed on is the TCP connection time from the Navtiming API, `navtiming.connect:15|ms`. For this request, it took 15ms to establish the TCP connection. This data is formatted using the [StatsD Metrics Export Specification](https://github.com/b/statsd_spec). This spec was initially developed by Flickr and iterated on by Etsy and others. It is a format that storage engines like [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) are built to handle.

After formatting this beacon data, it is passed on to our 3rd component for further processing.

**Component 3: Metrics Aggregator**

The 3rd component may be one of the harder ones to understand. This component listens for data sent to it via the 2nd component and pools this data for storage by the 4th component. This component stores data in memory for a fixed amount of time (e.g., 10 seconds), and sends the aggregated data along to the 4th component for storage. For instance, if 20 unique pieces of `navtiming.connect` data are sent to this component, it will take the average, median, min, max, and 95th percentile values and pass it along to the 4th component for storage. This is a simple way to reduce the overall amount of data stored, while also limiting the data writes to only 1 per specified time period. This allows developers to maintain a high level of data precision while maintaining the scalability of the monitoring system.

The most popular component to use for data aggregation is [StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd). Developed by [Etsy](http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2011/02/15/measure-anything-measure-everything/), StatsD is a Node server that aggregates data and passes it along to a storage engine via UDP (recommended) or TCP to the 4th component, a storage engine. In this article, I will actually be talking about [DogstatsD](http://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/dogstatsd/), which implements the StatsD protocol and was developed for the [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) monitoring SaaS. It works just like StatsD, but has the advantaged of being installed along with the Datadog agent and preconfigured for the Datadog storage engine.

Once StatsD or DogstatsD aggregates a metrics, it sends it along to the 4th component that stores the aggregated data.

**Component 4: Metrics Storage Engine**

We've climbed mountains to format the data. Now, its time to store the fruits of our labor. A popular application for storing metrics data is [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/). Graphite allows you to store data within a scalable architecture and expose the data through a simple graphing interface. The little bit that I've experimented with Graphite has been positive; however, it has been a downright pain to get set up.

As an alternative to installing and managing Graphite, I will be discussing the [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com) SaaS in this article. Datadog is a hosted monitoring solution. After installing Datadog's software on your server, it'll start sending basic server information to the SaaS for you to view in highly configurable graphs and dashboards. Its API allows you to store pretty much any information you want. Even better, the service is free if you are ok with storing data for only 24 hours.

In an effort to make this walkthrough more manageable, we'll be using Datadog as the storage engine and monitoring solution. Once the data gets to Datadog, we have nothing left to do, but view the data.

**Bringing it Together**

Before moving on to installation information, let's stop to summarize what we've discussed so far. We have a 4 step process that begins by measuring data and ends with storing it using a SaaS. The data takes the following route:

1. Measured with Boomerang JS on the client and beaconed
1. Boomcatch consumes the beacon data, prepares and sends it to DogstatsD
1. DogstatsD aggregates 10 seconds worth of data and passes it along for storage
1. Datadog stores the data for viewing within their admin panel

Note that any of these 4 components can be exchanged for alternatives and in some cases, skipped completely. What I like about these components are that each one has a distinct purposes and is built without concern for any for other components in the system.

In this article, I am presenting the tools I am using as a simple and dirt cheap way to get started with monitoring. The implementation I will discuss is not built for high traffic, high availability monitoring; rather, it focuses on a reasonably approachable and affordable solution for those without big budgets who want to begin with RUM. Most certainly, this set up can be enhanced to handle a more robust load, but this article will not discuss those details.

## Installing Boomerang

Setting up Boomerang is a convoluted process of adding JS to your website. It basically comes down to adding a script to your site, but the documentation will drive you nuts trying to figure out exactly how to put it all together. Hopefully I can help clarify some of the pain points.

For Boomerang to work, you must include the [main Boomerang script](https://github.com/lognormal/boomerang/blob/master/boomerang.js), as well as at least one [plugin](https://github.com/lognormal/boomerang/blob/master/plugins) and configure the Boomerang with at least a the `beacon_url` option. Boomerang has 15 plugins available and you can write additional plugins as you see fit. To get started, you need to pick at least one plugin. I initially chose the [navtiming.js](https://github.com/lognormal/boomerang/blob/master/plugins/navtiming.js) and [rt.js](https://github.com/lognormal/boomerang/blob/master/plugins/rt.js) plugins, which collect metrics from the W3C Navigation Timing API and round trip time, respectively. I also chose to send the beacon requests simply to `/beacon`. I downloaded all of my chosen scripts and added the following to the footer of my site:

{% highlight html %}
<script src="/js/boomerang.js"></script>
<script src="/js/rt.js"></script>
<script src="/js/navtiming.js"></script>
<script>
  BOOMR.init({
    beacon_url: "/beacon"
  });
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

With this minimal setup, I could see that the measurement and beaconing was working by viewing the network tab in Chrome. It showed that a request to `/beacon` with a number of `GET` variables was indeed issued. Without having set up the `/beacon` endpoint, this request 404'ed. Viewing the request, I could see that the following data was sent:

{% highlight bash %}
rt.start:navigation

rt.bstart:1435637445344

{% endhighlight %}

Clearly things are working! If you are following along, I'd recommend experimenting with additional plugins at this time to see the data that it will produce. All you need to do is add the `script` tag for the plugin that you wish to try and view the resulting data to see if it fits your needs.

If you read the documentation for Boomerang, it will suggest that you use an async loading mechanism for the scripts. In my experience, I completely agree. Just adding this monitoring to my site cost me about 500ms in start render time. Given that my start render was at about 700ms, this was not acceptable. I used the recommended async loading technique as a result<span class="footnote-article-number">1</span>.

The documentation will suggest that you use an included `make` command to build a single concatenated and minified script to async load; however, in my experience, this `make` command was badly broken. It seemed to include plugins I did not want, as well as exclude ones I did want. As such, I recommend skipping the `make` command. Instead, manually add boomerang.js, the desired plugins, and the call to `BOOMR.init` in a file. Be sure to minify it after concatenating these files. Name it with a version number to make it easy to purge from caches if you ever update it.

Once you have the single file prepared, add the following code to the *header* of your site, being sure to update the path to the concatenated and minified file:

{% highlight html %}
<script async>
(function(d, s) {
   var js = d.createElement(s),
       sc = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];

   js.src="/js/boomerang-2.js";
   sc.parentNode.insertBefore(js, sc);
}(document, "script"));
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

With this async loading method in place, I was able to see a better start render and visually complete time, although, I still could not get it close to the times I saw prior to setting up the monitoring. This is something I want to improve.

## Installing Boomcatch

Now that Boomerang is sending requests to `/beacon`, we need to set up Boomcatch to receive those requests. Boomcatch is a interprets a request URL and converts the data into the StatsD metric format to pass along to DogstatsD. It takes the raw data passed as `GET` variables shown above and translates it in into metrics data. I like to use Boomcatch for this because it was built by the maintainers of Boomerang for the sole purpose of processing Boomerang beacon requests for StatsD. Conceptually, this is simple software; however, it's a tedious application to write and happy to use something that just works. Boomcatch has properly handled all of the Boomerang plugin data that I've thrown at it.

Boomcatch is highly customizable, but most importantly allows you to specify the following:

1. Validators: checks that will either allow a request to proceed or exit
1. Filters: remove unnecessary pieces of data
1. Mappers: converts data from one format to another
1. Forwarders: sends the mapped data to another service to be further processed

These four processes allow a developer to customize the data for the 3rd component's needs. Fortunately, all of the processes are automatically handled via Boomcatch when using Boomerang and its plugins. If you develop your own Boomerang plugin, you would need to write components for Boomcatch to handle that new data.

As I walk through installing Boomcatch, I will be focusing on installing on Ubuntu 14.04. Since Boomcatch is a Node application, it shouldn't be too tough to apply these instructions to other distros. Before starting, make sure you have `nodejs` and `npm` installed:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install nodejs
{% endhighlight %}

To save you some headache, I ran into an issue with trying to run Boomcatch as a daemon when because Node is `nodejs` on Ubuntu. I [symlinked](http://askubuntu.com/a/477587) `nodejs` to `node`:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
{% endhighlight %}

With this set, we just need to install the `boomcatch` package:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo npm install boomcatch -g
{% endhighlight %}

If everything went well, you should be able to see the available options with the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
boomcatch --help
{% endhighlight %}

Boomcatch is an HTTP(S) server with an integrated application. Most of the options available are intended to configure how the server behaves. There are many ways in which you can set up the server. What I'll show you here is my preference for the system I'm discussing, but please read through the options and configure the right setup for yourself.

The primary options I want to configure are `port` and `host`. I'm setting this up on a server that also hosts the website itself and need to make sure that I'm connecting using a different port. As such, I run Boomcatch with the following settings:

{% highlight bash %}
boomcatch --port 8888 --host 127.0.0.1
{% endhighlight %}

Running this command will showing logging in the terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
2015-07-02 12:37:34 INFO boomcatch: starting boomcatch in process 14737 with options:
{
    "port": 8888,
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "log": {},
    "workers": 1
}
2015-07-02 12:37:34 INFO boomcatch: worker 14739 started
2015-07-02 12:37:34 INFO boomcatch: listening for 127.0.0.1:8888/beacon
{% endhighlight %}

This will only accept connections from the server on port 8888. To test if Boomcatch is working, open another terminal window, SSH into the server and issue the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
curl 127.0.0.1/beacon:8888
{ "error": "Invalid path `/`" }
{% endhighlight %}

If you look at the Boomcatch output, you'll see:

{% highlight bash %}
2015-07-02 12:39:51 INFO boomcatch: referer= user-agent=curl/7.35.0 address=127.0.0.1[] method=GET url=/?test
2015-07-02 12:39:51 ERROR boomcatch: 404 Invalid path `/`
{% endhighlight %}

While we are seeing errors here, that is ok. This means that the Boomcatch server is listening to the right port and things seem to be working.

You may be wondering why I am setting up Boomcatch to only listen to requests from `127.0.0.1`. This means that requests can only come from the server itself. For my setup, I am doing this in order to simplify my HTTP/2 and TLS setup. I currently use [`Nghttpx`](/http2-nghttp2-nginx-tls/) as an HTTP/2 proxy. I want to connect to Boomcatch through Nghttpx so that these requests enjoy the HTTP/2 and TLS benefits that I get from Nghttpx. Thus, I use Nghttpx as a proxy for Boomcatch. To make things a little more difficult, I push the request through Nginx. The request goes from Nghttpx => Nginx => Boomcatch.

To facilitate this, I need to add a `location` block to Nginx:

{% highlight bash %}
location ~* /beacon(.*)$ {
    proxy_pass    http://127.0.0.1:8888;
}
{% endhighlight %}

I use Nginx's `location` block and `proxy_pass` directive to proxy requests to `/beacon` to `127.0.0.1:8888` where my Boomcatch server is located. I like this setup personally because I manage all TLS related concerns in once place, as opposed to configuring TLS in two places (one for Nghttpx and another for Boomcatch). Additionally, Nghttpx offers better HTTPS configuration capabilities than Boomcatch.

All that said, you can definitely use Boomcatch's options to configure your setup however you want. If you set a non-local host name and make sure the port is open, you will be able to connect to it without much trouble.

Now that we can connect to Boomcatch locally and externally with a little Nginx hackery, let's set up Boomcatch to run as a daemon. To do so, I turned to Forever, a Node package for running Node servers as daemons. First, you need to install Forever:

{% highlight bash %}
npm install forever
{% endhighlight %}

Also, when I run Forever, I will be logging a few different things. You need to create these logs before running the Forever command:

{% highlight bash %}
# Set up needed logs
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/boomcatch/
sudo touch /var/log/boomcatch/boomcatch-forever.log
sudo touch /var/log/boomcatch/boomcatch-access.log
sudo touch /var/log/boomcatch/boomcatch-error.log
{% endhighlight %}

Using the following command, Boomcatch is executed as a daemon (note that I am creating logs before starting Forever):

{% highlight bash %}
# Set up needed logs
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/boomcatch/
sudo touch /var/log/boomcatch/boomcatch-forever.log
sudo touch /var/log/boomcatch/boomcatch-access.log
sudo touch /var/log/boomcatch/boomcatch-error.log

sudo forever -sa \
  -l /var/log/boomcatch/boomcatch-forever.log \
  -o /var/log/boomcatch/boomcatch-access.log \
  -e /var/log/boomcatch/boomcatch-error.log \

With Forever running Boomcatch as a daemon, the server will run until you quit it. You can detach the terminal and it will still be running. You can see if it is running by checking the running processes:

{% highlight bash %}
ps aux | grep boomcatch

Alternatively, you can `tail` the Boomcatch access log, issues requests and look for a new log to be generated:

{% highlight bash %}
tail -f /var/log/boomcatch/boomcatch-access.log

As long as you are seeing new logs generated as you visit your site, things are working correctly. With Boomcatch installed and configured, we will now move on the final two components, which are installed and configured together.

## Installing Datadog with DogstatsD

## Setting up Dashboards


<p class="footnote"><span class="footnote-footer-number">1</span> If you read the Boomerang JS documentation, they recommend another async technique involving <a href="http://www.phpied.com/non-onload-blocking-async-js/">loading an iframe</a>. I tried and tried to get this method to work, but to no avail. It would simply not collect all of the metrics that Boomerang was supposed to collect when using the iframe technique.
